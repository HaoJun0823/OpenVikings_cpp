# Windows vehicle lifecycle reconstruction

## Vehicle lifecycle and complete chest rewards - 2026-10-07

Following `d387c05`, C2VehicleLifecycle connects Windows vehicle allocation/init/free/exit, initial idle/animation/walking selection, native placement/overlap searches, passenger reset/movement checks and human/vehicle move-out/detachment. Reward 89 now uses the real allocator, so every Windows chest content branch is connected and event 33 has no chest-reward staging guard. Vehicle AI/tick/task/boarding/combat functionality is not implied complete.

The Windows misc-landscape manager constructor (0048A4BA) now loads both owned mapping arrays and weighted groups from the original misc.ini. Exact cadaver mapping (0048A86C/00480904) and random depot mapping (0048A8A1/004808F4) retain original matching order, random-call timing and type-zero fallback. The complete 00568548..00568567 storage/token/owner region and Windows token/name strings were inspected. Existing destruction retains ownership. The landscape-edit operation 0040B0C6 remains a link dummy, so animal/vehicle exit remain partial and excluded from completion claims.

Game.exe bytes correct the disassembly at 0044CA93: sign-extended imm8 FF writes -1. The path radius at 004F3B24 is 60. Movement readiness checks the inclusive commander slot and attached vehicles. Idle sends nearby humans away over the footprint; it does not directly change terrain blockage. Failed relocation returns in the native order. All behavior/offsets/constants come from Windows ASM/Game.exe; Mac supplied names only; the Windows depot-wrapper name remains unresolved and its current name is inferred from call sites.

Eight affected cpp files passed MSVC Win32 `/Zs`; no Debug/Release build, tests or gameplay run. Project/filter parity: **195 cpp / 185 headers**. Inventories: **862 naming rows / 109 unfinished boundaries**. Counts are inventories, not functional coverage. User-owned count.bat deletion remains excluded.

Next: finish the human attack/task-14 tree reachable from civilian idle, remaining outdoor and human vehicle workflows, creature AI/tick callbacks and death-edit dependencies. All reported freezes remain unconfirmed until runtime validation.

Address-to-name inventory is in FUNCTION_NAME_MAP.csv. Original addresses are retained on definitions. No inline assembly or new link dummies were introduced.
